<h1 class="question">What Makes YouGuard Different?</h1>
<div class="secondpara">
<p>A common misconception in the world of IT security is that Pass-the-Hash and -Pass-the-ticket attacks are something of the past. The reality is that this is not the case since traditional solutions such as Kerebros(Windows Native Smart Card Solution) generate a hash which is everlasting. Due to this reason, Pass-the-Hash attacks become particulary problematic and thus the enviornment in question is not really secure. Furthermore traditional 2FA software is extremely rigid, generally leaving a gap between a customers security policy and their options. YouGuard is different; it allows you to fully construct your 2FA solution to match your exact security policy in a simple way and with total control. By default YouGuard operates in collaboration with your Active Directory setup, however users have the option to operate in total autonomy; essentially severing ties to the domain provider. This means that YouGuard could operate entirely independant of any type of domain and can even run on a stand alone computer.</p>
